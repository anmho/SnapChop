# Snap_FinalShowCase
This is the repo for the Snap final showcase

<strong> 1. Target user:</strong> 
BIPOC 13-24 year olds living in food desert communities
We talked to non-profit partner <strong>Our Own </strong>, and we learned about the lack of accessible healthy foods due to not knowing where/when/how to get these foods
Relevant statistics: 
Our Own gave out 150K meals in 2020-2021 in South LA

<strong> 2. Problem Space:</strong>
Problem space: Lack of awareness and accessibility of healthy foods
We talked to non-profit partner Our Own, and we learned about XYZ
Ways to approach our Target Audience
Relevant statistics: 
Gave out 150,000 meals in 2020-2021 in LA

<strong>What we found surprising: </strong>
Our Own once received a photo of someone cooking a whole onion cut in half directly on a pan without properly cutting it. This illustrates that despite people being given access to healthy food, they are not educated and empowered on how to prepare the food. 
The problem we want to tackle in one sentence: 
Empowering BIPOC Gen Z communities living in food deserts to take charge of their health through education and awareness

<strong> Run Project </strong>
